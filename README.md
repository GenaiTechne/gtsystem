# GenAI Techne System (gtsystem)
*A low code Python package for crafting GenAI applications quickly*

GenAI Techne is on a mission to help enterprise and professionals excel in the craft of Generative AI. Check out the [GenAI Techne Substack](https://genaitechne.substack.com/) where you can read more about our mission, read gtsystem documentation, learn from step-by-step tutorials, and influence the roadmap of gtsystem for your use cases.

## Getting Started

The get started using `gtsystem` package follow these steps.

**Step 1.** Install gtsystem package using `pip install gtsystem`

**Step 2.** Open a Jupyter notebook and try this sample.

```python
from gtsystem import openai, bedrock, ollama
prompt = 'How many faces does a tetrahedron have?'
openai.gpt_text(prompt)
bedrock.llama_text(prompt)
bedrock.claude_text(prompt)
ollama.mistral_text(prompt)
```

## Features and Notebook Samples

The `gtsystem` package source is available in this [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/GenaiTechne/gtsystem).

You can read more about the vision behind gtsystem on the [GenAI Techne substack post](https://genaitechne.substack.com/p/excelling-in-the-craft-of-generative).

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenaiTechne/gtsystem/main/gtsystem-features.jpg)](https://genaitechne.substack.com/p/excelling-in-the-craft-of-generative)

You can learn `gtsystem` API by following along the [notebook samples](https://github.com/GenaiTechne/gtsystem/tree/main/notebooks) included in the `gtsystem` repo. This samples are documented on the [GenAI Techne Substack](https://genaitechne.substack.com/).

1. **Evaluate models using one line of code:** Refer `01-evaluate.ipynb` for single statement prompt evaluations across multiple models including OpenAI GPT, Bedrock hosted Claude or Llama.

2. **Render LLM responses:** Use `02-render.ipynb` for well formatted rendering of the model responses including markdown tables.

3. **Load evaluation tasks from Excel:** Try `03-tasks.ipynb` for automating evaluation tasks - find, list, load prompts by task, including optimal parameter values for temperature and TopP.

4. **Instrument speed and size (cost) of response:** Reuse `04-instrument.ipynb` for instrumenting and comparing multiple models across latency and size of response.

4. **Benchmark quality of response:** Use `05-benchmark.ipynb` for automated benchmarking quality of responses from models like Llama and Claude using GPT-4 as an LLM evaluator.

5. **Run models on your laptop:** Get `06-ollama.ipynb` to run models like Mistral, Llama, and Llava locally on your laptop and compare models hosted on Cloud or proprietary model APIs.

## Installing Dependencies

You can install following dependencies to work with `gtsystem` based on your needs. Start with our `requirements.txt` or create your own. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within your environment.

```
# GenAI Techne System
gtsystem

# Python capabilities
pandas
markdown
openpyxl

# Jupyter notebook
jupyterlab
ipywidgets

# AWS for Bedrock managed models
boto3
awscli
botocore

# OpenAI for GPT models
openai

# Ollama for LLMs running on your laptop
ollama
```

## Amazon Bedrock Setup

To use [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) hosted models like Llama and Claude follow these steps.

**Step 1.** Login to AWS Console > Launch Identity and Access Management (IAM) > Create a user for Command-Line Interface (CLI) access. 
*Read [Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html) for more details.*

**Step 2.** Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) > Run `aws configure` in Terminal > Add credentials from Step 1.

## Ollama Setup

To use Ollama provided LLMs locally on your laptop follow these steps.

**Step 1.** Download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
*Note the memory requirements for each model. 7b models generally require at least 8GB of RAM. 13b models generally require at least 16GB of RAM. 70b models generally require at least 64GB of RAM*

**Step 2.** Find model Ollama [library](https://ollama.com/library) > Run command `ollama pull <model>` in terminal to download the model.
*Currently gtsystem supports popular models like llama2, mistral, and llava.*

## OpenAI Setup

To use OpenAI models follow these steps.

**Step 1.** Signup for [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) access and get the API key.

**Step 2.** Add OpenAI API Key to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` using `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"`

## Basic Python Environment

If you are new to Python then here is how you can get started from scratch.

First, you should be running the latest Python on your system with Python package manager upgraded to the latest.

```bash
python --version
# should return Python 3.10.x or higher as on Jan'23
pip --version
# should return pip 22.3.x or higher as on Jan'23
```

Follow this guide for [Mac OS X](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) if you do not have the latest Python. If installing specific version of Python for managing dependencies then follow [this thread](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/237430/how-to-install-specific-version-of-python-on-os-x) to install using `pyenv` Python version manager. If required upgrade pip to the latest using the following command.

```bash
pip install --user --upgrade pip
```

We will now create a virtual environment for our MLOps setup so that our dependencies are isolated and do not conflict with the system installed packages. We will follow [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) for creating and managing the virtual environment. First change to the directory where we will develop our application.

```bash
python -m venv env
```

If you run ls env you will see following folders and files created.

```bash
bin        include    lib        pyvenv.cfg
```

Now we can activate our virtual environment like so. You will notice that development directory prefixed with the (env) to indicate you are now running in the virtual environment.

```bash
. env/bin/activate
```

You can confirm that you are not running inside the virtual environment with its own Python.

```bash
which python
## should return /Users/.../env/bin/python
```

To leave the virtual environment using deactivate command. Re-enter using same command as earlier.
