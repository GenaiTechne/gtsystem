       "1. Use a hash set:\n",
       "   - Create an empty hash set.\n",
       "   - Iterate through each element `num` in `nums`.\n",
       "   - Check if `k - num` exists in the hash set. If it does, return `True` because we have found a pair of elements that sum up to `k`.\n",
       "   - If `k - num` is not in the hash set, add `num` to the hash set.\n",
       "   - If no pair is found after the iteration, return `False`.\n",
       "   - This approach reduces the time complexity to O(n) since we only need to iterate through the list once.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Sort the list and use two pointers:\n",
       "   - Sort the `nums` list in ascending order.\n",
       "   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the start and end of the sorted list, respectively.\n",
       "   - While `left` is less than `right`, do the following:\n",
       "     - If the sum of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` equals `k`, return `True`.\n",
       "     - If the sum is less than `k`, increment `left` to consider a larger value.\n",
       "     - If the sum is greater than `k`, decrement `right` to consider a smaller value.\n",
       "   - If no pair is found after the iteration, return `False`.\n",
       "   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, but it reduces the comparison steps.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an example implementation using the hash set approach:\n",

       "1. Use a hash table to keep track of the elements that have already been seen, so that you can avoid checking the same element twice. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\n",
       "2. Sort the list and then use two pointers to iterate through the list, starting from the beginning and end, respectively. If the sum of the elements at the current positions of the pointers is equal to k, return True. This would also reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\n",
       "3. Use a more efficient data structure such as a hash table or a tree-based data structure to store the elements in the list, so that you can efficiently check for the presence of an element with a given sum. This would further reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) or O(n).\n",
       "4. Parallelize the search by dividing the list into smaller chunks and checking each chunk in parallel using multiple processes or threads. This would allow you to check more elements in parallel, which could further reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) or O(n).\n",
       "5. Use a more efficient algorithm such as the \"Two Sum\" problem, which has a time complexity of O(n), to find the two elements with a given sum in the list. This would allow you to avoid checking every possible combination of elements and instead focus on finding the optimal solution."
